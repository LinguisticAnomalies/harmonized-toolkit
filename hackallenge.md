## For the Hackallenge

### Defining Classes and Data Selection

Participants are required to define their own label to the existing Dementia Bank and WLS dataset. More specifically, participants need to **define** each data samples as one of two categories "positive" vs. "negative" with provided metadata.

### Analysis Pipeline

Participants are required to design their own analysis pipeline with the given pre-processing pipeline.

### Reporting and Submitting Manifest

While we do not ask participants to upload or share their analysis pipeline, participants need to report the details of their pre-processing, data seleciton and analysis pipeline in a **.json** file.

Please find the baseline manifest in the ```files``` folder.

We also provide a simply script to valiate your manifest. Before sumitting, please run ``scripts/manifest_checker.py`` to make sure your manifest is validated.
